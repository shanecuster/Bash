# Bash

I am in the process of teaching myself how to script. I have come up with a simple upgrade script that I use that upgrades my system that I do several times a week. I also have a setup sctipt that I am working on as of right now. I have several different machines that I run Fedora on and I want to have a system of setting them all up the same way from the start. 

I will likely add new scrips as I find new things that I learn and need to accomplish.
